## Course Description

This course is designed to be an overview of the major sociological theories, concepts, principles, and experiences that shape the human experience in United States. Students will be challenged to see beyond individual choices to see how social institutions and systems affect the day to day lives of all of us. We will examine the major substantive areas of sociology including theory, methods, culture, socialization, inequality, and social institutions. Students will learn the basic principles of sociology and use that information to analyze the world around them. The major goal of this course is for students to critically analyze society and their social location within it. Also, students will be asked to critically analyze how they think about certain social situations.

## Student Learning Outcomes

1. Provide students the opportunity to develop the skills to see the world like a sociologist and learn how sociologists use science to explore how society operates and create social change.
2. Explore the connection between inequality, prejudice, and discrimination.
3. Challenge “common sense” and debunk social myths.
4. Develop critical self-evaluation skills. (i.e. be a fly on the inside of your mind).
